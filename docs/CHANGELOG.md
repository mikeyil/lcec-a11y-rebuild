#### `src/content/webinars-and-training.md`

- Meta description changed from "professional development" to "training" (consistency with other changes)

## 2026-04-21 — DRY pass, CMS-readiness, and README restructuring

### Templates

- `partials/header.njk`, `partials/footer.njk`, `layouts/contact.njk` — replaced hardcoded `"LC Education Consulting"` with `{{ site.name }}` in logo text, footer brand, copyright line, and Web3Forms `subject`/`from_name` hidden inputs

### SCSS

- `_variables.scss` — added `@mixin link-state-primary` (hover/focus on light backgrounds) and `@mixin link-state-on-dark` (hover/focus on dark backgrounds)
- `_nav.scss` — replaced four identical hover/focus blocks in `.nav__link`, `.nav__dropdown-btn`, `.nav__dropdown-link`, `.mobile-nav__link` with `@include link-state-primary`
- `_footer.scss` — replaced hover/focus blocks in `.footer-nav__link` and `.footer-brand, .footer-phone a` with `@include link-state-on-dark`

### Docs

- `README.md` — moved "About This Build" section (Accessibility, Security, Performance, SEO, Documentation) to `docs/ABOUT_BUILD.md`; replaced with a single-line link
- `docs/ABOUT_BUILD.md` — new file containing the full build methodology documentation

---

## 2026-04-21 — UI fixes, accessibility, and code consolidation

### Accessibility

- `_layout.scss` — Links inside `.section--blue p` now use `$color-primary-light` (#e3fcc2) — 7.9:1 contrast against the blue background; hover goes to white
- `_hero.scss` — `.btn--primary:focus` inside `.hero__actions` now uses a white outline (was dark green, low contrast against the olive background)
- `_components.scss` — `.btn--ghost:focus` now uses a white outline; `.btn--outline:focus` now fills with `$color-primary-dark` and sets `border-color` to match, consistent with hover

### Visual fixes

- `src/_includes/layouts/*.njk` — Six section headings across four pages (Our Philosophy, Professional Background, Why LC Education Consulting, Training Topics, Start a Conversation, Contact Us) changed to `content-blocks__heading text-uppercase` to match the "Featured Projects" reference style
- `_utilities.scss` — `.section--flush-top .content-blocks__heading` now has `margin-top: 0` so headings on flush sections (Why Choose Us, Contact) don't add unwanted top gap
- `_sections.scss` — `content-blocks__grid` spacing changed from `padding-bottom` to `margin-bottom: $space-32px` for consistent spacing below service grids
- `_sections.scss` — `credentials-layout__photo` now has `margin-top: $space-32px` at all sizes, aligning the photo with the heading on the text side
- `_forms.scss` — Removed top padding from `.contact-form-section`; added `.contact-office` block for spacing around the office/phone/email heading

### Data fixes

- `partials/social-section.njk` — LinkedIn URL was hardcoded; now uses `{{ site.linkedinUrl }}` from `site.json`

### CSS consolidation

- `_typography.scss` — Removed unused `%heading-section-base`, `.heading--section`, and `.detail-heading` (all templates migrated to `content-blocks__heading`)
- `_components.scss` — Removed unused `.card` class
- `_components.scss` — Removed redundant `padding` declaration from `.btn` desktop media query (identical to base)
- `_components.scss` — Moved floating `.section--blue .cta-block__subheading` rule inside `.cta-block` as a contextual modifier; simplified desktop padding shorthand
- `_forms.scss` — Submit button `:focus` now uses `@include focus-outline($color-primary, $radius: true)` instead of raw properties
- `_sections.scss` — Replaced five hard-coded spacing values (`1rem`, `1.5rem`, `0.5rem`) with `$space-*` tokens
- `_sections.scss` — Removed redundant `font-size: $font-size-base` in `bio-layout__body` desktop breakpoint (same as base value); `margin-top: 1rem` → `$space-16px`
- `_layout.scss` — Removed redundant `padding: $space-16px 0` from `.section--blue` (already provided by `.section`)

### JS consolidation

- `utils/dom.js` — Added `handleFocusTrap(container, event, selector?)` utility
- `main.js` — Both `initNavigation` and `initExitModal` now use `handleFocusTrap` instead of duplicated inline focus-trap logic

---

## 2026-04-18 — A11y fixes, content links, and image improvements

### `src/_includes/layouts/webinars-and-training.njk`

- Fixed duplicate heading text — `<h2>` was rendering `{{ intro.heading }}` ("Webinars and Training"), identical to the `<h1>` in the page wrapper; now renders `{{ trainings_heading }}` ("Training Topics")
- Added `<picture>` wrapper with `<source type="image/webp">` so browsers that support WebP receive the `.webp` version; `.jpg` remains as fallback
- Added `width="600" height="400"` to prevent cumulative layout shift (CLS)

### `src/content/webinars-and-training.md`

- Added `trainings_heading: "Training Topics"` front matter field to support the heading fix above

### `src/_includes/layouts/why-choose-us.njk`

- Added `width="600" height="400"` to the career photo (`about-career.webp`) to prevent CLS
- Added `| safe` filter to `{{ paragraph | safe }}` so HTML in frontmatter strings (e.g., anchor tags) renders correctly rather than being escaped

### `src/_includes/layouts/our-story.njk`

- Added `| safe` filter to `{{ paragraph | safe }}` for the same reason

### `src/content/our-story.md`

- Added internal links in body copy: "web accessibility evaluations" links to `/accessibility-services/`; "webinars and training" links to `/webinars-and-training/`

### `src/content/why-choose-us.md`

- Added internal link: "digital accessibility knowledge" links to `/accessibility-services/`

### `src/scss/_variables.scss`

- Added `$color-placeholder: #6b6b6b` — dedicated token for form placeholder text; ~5.3:1 contrast on white (WCAG AA pass). Previous value `$color-gray` (#a9a9a9) was ~2.35:1 (WCAG fail)

### `src/scss/_forms.scss`

- Changed `::placeholder` color from `$color-gray` to `$color-placeholder` in both `.form-input` and `.form-textarea`

### `src/_includes/partials/head.njk` — GSC

- Added conditional `<meta name="google-site-verification">` — renders only when `site.gscVerificationId` is set

---

## 2026-04-18 — SEO enhancements

### `src/_includes/partials/head.njk`

- Title format changed to page-first: `Page Name | LC Education Consulting` — applied to `<title>`, `og:title`, and `twitter:title`
- Business schema (`ProfessionalService`): added `sameAs` array with LinkedIn URL; `areaServed` upgraded from bare `"US"` string to structured `Country` type
- New `Person` JSON-LD block for Laura Cantagallo on every page (name, job title, portfolio URL, `worksFor`)
- Removed unused `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://calendar.app.google" />` (calendar is only an `<a>` link)

### `src/sitemap.njk`

- Added `<priority>` and `<changefreq>` to every URL entry — homepage `1.0`/`weekly`, inner pages `0.8`/`monthly`

### `src/_data/site.json`

- Added `linkedinUrl`, `googleBusinessUrl` (placeholder), and `founderUrl`

---

## 2026-04-18 — A11y, security, and optimization hardening

### `src/js/main.js`

- Replaced `innerHTML` SVG injection in `initExternalLinks` with `createElementNS` DOM API calls (eliminates XSS vector)
- Fixed `storageGet`/`storageSet` infinite recursion — both functions called themselves instead of `localStorage`; cookie consent, announcement bar, and footer nav state never persisted
- Extracted `makeCollapseToggle` factory shared by `initAnnouncementToggle` and `initFooterNavToggle`

### `src/scss/`

- `prefers-reduced-motion`: animations and transitions respect the OS setting
- `prefers-contrast`: high-contrast mode adjusts borders and fills
- `forced-colors`: SVG icons and decorative elements adapt to Windows forced-color mode

### Deployment

- Removed Netlify; both `lcec-prod` and `lcec-dev` deploy via GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions
- `PATH_PREFIX` moved to a per-repo GitHub Actions variable so the same workflow file serves both repos without modification
- Removed `netlify.toml` and `docs/setup-netlify.md`

---

## 2026-04-18 — Web3Forms key security

### `src/_data/env.js` *(new)*

- Reads `process.env.WEB3FORMS_KEY` at build time and exposes it to templates as `{{ env.web3formsKey }}`

### `src/_data/site.json` — Web3Forms

- Removed `web3formsKey` field — key no longer lives in the repository

### `src/_includes/layouts/contact.njk`

- Updated access key input to use `{{ env.web3formsKey }}`

### `.github/workflows/pages-main.yml`

- Added `WEB3FORMS_KEY: ${{ secrets.WEB3FORMS_KEY }}` to the build step environment

---

## 2026-04-17 — Content updates

### `src/index.md`

- Updated WebAIM Million stat from 98% to 95.9% — reflects the 2026 WebAIM Million report; label updated to include the year
- Updated ADA Title II deadlines per DOJ interim final rule extending them by one year: April 2027 (large entities, 50,000+ population), April 2028 (smaller entities)

### `src/content/*.md` — per-page meta descriptions

- Added unique `description` field to all content pages; `head.njk` uses it with a site-level fallback

---

## 2026-04-17 — SEO fixes and axe-core linting

### Content

### SEO / markup

- Removed `<meta name="keywords">` tag (no SERP value, potential spam signal)
- Fixed `tel:` href country code — now `tel:+18563104483` throughout
- Added `rel="noreferrer"` to all `target="_blank"` external links
- Added `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://api.web3forms.com" />`
- Fixed `pathToTitle` filter to skip minor words (a, an, the, of, and, etc.) in title case

### `npm run lint:a11y` *(new)*

- axe-core + jsdom scan of all built HTML in `dist/`; catches WCAG violations at build time

### Forms

- Web3Forms: email field renamed to `name="replyto"` so Laura's reply goes directly to the submitter
- `from_name` set to "LC Education Consulting" in the hidden field

---

## 2026-04-17 — Web3Forms integration

- Replaced Netlify Forms with Web3Forms for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Contact form posts to `https://api.web3forms.com/submit`
- Redirect to `/contact-success/` on successful submission
- Honeypot `botcheck` field added for spam prevention
- Access key stored in `src/_data/site.json` at this stage (later moved to GitHub Actions secret — see 2026-04-18)

---

## 2026-04-17 — DRY refactoring

- Calendar URL centralized in `site.json` as `calendar_url` — was repeated across 4 templates
- Section heading tokens — `%heading-section-base` Sass placeholder shared by `.heading--section` and `.detail-heading`
- Form field base — `%form-field-base` Sass placeholder shared by `.form-input` and `.form-textarea`
- Navigation phone and email dereferenced from hardcoded strings to `{{ office.phone_href }}` / `{{ office.phone }}`
- GitHub setup docs (`docs/setup-github.md`) and general README rewritten to reflect current architecture
